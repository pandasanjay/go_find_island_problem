#Find the Number of Islands

Given a 2-dimensional grid consisting of 1's (land blocks) and 0's (water blocks), count the number of islands present in the grid. The definition of an island is as follows:
- Must be surrounded by water blocks.
- Consists of land blocks (1's) connected to adjacent land blocks (either vertically or horizontally).
Assume all edges outside of the grid are water.
